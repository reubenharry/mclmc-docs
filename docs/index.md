# Microcanonical Monte Carlo

[Microcanonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](references/#microcanonical-hamiltonian-monte-carlo) (MCHMC) and its cousin [Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo](references/#microcanonical-hamiltonian-monte-carlo) (MCLMC) constitute a new sampling algorithm for distributions with differentiable log likelihoods.

This website exists as a supplement to those papers, in order to explain [the theory behind the algorithm](tutorial.md) in more detail, and document [a variety of applications](applications.md) to which it is presently being applied.

See [here](https://github.com/JakobRobnik/MicroCanonicalHMC) for an implementation in Jax (a Python library).
