# Microcanonical Monte Carlo

[Microcanonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](references/#microcanonical-hamiltonian-monte-carlo) (MCHMC) and its cousin [Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo](references/#microcanonical-hamiltonian-monte-carlo) (MCLMC) constitute a new sampling algorithm for distributions with differentiable log likelihoods, introduced with the goal of replacing the current state of the art differentiable sampler, NUTS.

A Python implementation is available in Blackjax: https://blackjax-devs.github.io/sampling-book/algorithms/mclmc.html

This website exists as a supplement to those papers, in order to explain [the theory behind the algorithm](tutorial.md) in more detail, and document [a variety of applications](applications.md) to which it is presently being applied.
