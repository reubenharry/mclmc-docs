## Installation

MCLMC is available in Blackjax, so first install it:

`pip install blackjax`

Then see https://blackjax-devs.github.io/sampling-book/algorithms/mclmc.html for comprehensive instructions on how to run the algorithm.

!!! Note
    MCLMC is not designed to run in 1 dimension. Its best performance is for high dimensional multimodal problems, but it should perform well in most settings.
